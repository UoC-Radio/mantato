A metadata flow manager for receiving and propagating song metadata based on [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

Currently supports only autopilot metadata, however some stub functionality is already there to support messages from [producer's dashboard](https://github.com/UoC-Radio/py-producers-dashboard).
